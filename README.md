This project was made for a team feedback as a way to anonymously express problems or good actions on a monthly basis.

Used as a simple suggestion box it worked with all sorts of feedbacks and helped nurture a healthy team that would meet every month and read all "suggestions". Discussing these feedbacks face-to-face and in a general way, without pointing fingers.

This led the team to a good way of identifying the root problem of processes, technical flaws and even social communication.
